<h5 class="text-primary"><b><em>At a glance:</b></em></h5>    
		<p>Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War; succeeding in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, strengthening the federal government, and modernizing the economy.</p>
		<p>Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln was born in Hodgenville, Kentucky and was a self-educated lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader, and later, an elected member of the Illinois House of Representatives, in which he served for eight years.</p>
		<p>In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination and though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was elected president. His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union.</p> 
		<p>Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. Some of his tactics included pitting his opponents against each other, carefully planned political patronage, and appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. For instance, his Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy.</p>
		<p>With his primary goal being to reunite the nation, Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful one, Ulysses S. Grant. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.</p>
		<p>An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.</p>
		<p>Among American heroes, Lincoln continues to have a unique appeal for his fellow countrymen and also for people of other lands. This charm derives from his remarkable life story—the rise from humble origins, the dramatic death—and from his distinctively human and humane personality as well as from his historical role as saviour of the Union and emancipator of the slaves. His relevance endures and grows especially because of his eloquence as a spokesman for democracy. In his view, the Union was worth saving not only for its own sake but because it embodied an ideal, the ideal of self-government. In recent years, the political side to Lincoln’s character, and his racial views in particular, have come under close scrutiny, as scholars continue to find him a rich subject for research.</p>
		<p>Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the three greatest U.S. presidents.</p>
